Purpose of the Project: ETL Process for Weather Data
This program performs the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for weather forecast data from the OpenWeather API. The goal is to:

Extract: Get weather data from the OpenWeather API.
Transform: Clean and process the data, converting temperatures and structuring it for analysis.
Load: Store the processed data in a PostgreSQL database for future access.


ETL BREAKDOWN 
1. Extract (Getting Data from the API)
The first step in the ETL process is extraction, where we fetch raw weather data from the OpenWeather API.
API Request: The program makes an HTTP request to the OpenWeather API, asking for weather data in JSON format. Hereâ€™s how the request is made:
city is the location you want to get weather data for.
cnt=240 specifies how many forecast hours to retrieve (default is 240).
appid is your API key, which gives access to the data.


2. Transform (Data Cleaning and Processing)
The second step is transformation, where the raw data is cleaned, formatted, and transformed into a useful structure.
Temperature Conversion: The temperature from the OpenWeather API is in Kelvin, but we need it in Celsius for easier understanding.
Data Extraction: We loop through the extracted JSON data and extract key information such as:

Date and Time
Temperature, Feels Like Temperature
Pressure, Humidity
Weather Condition (e.g., Clear, Rainy)
Wind Speed and Direction
Cloudiness, Rain, Snow
Each piece of data is cleaned, transformed (e.g., converting timestamps to readable date/time), and added to a list of dictionaries.


3. Load (Storing Data in PostgreSQL)
The final step is loading, where we save the processed data into a database for later access and analysis.
Database Connection: The program connects to a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy. The credentials (username, password, database name, etc.) are used to establish the connection.
Storing Data: The DataFrame is loaded into a PostgreSQL table using the to_sql() method




ETL Process Flow Summary

Extract:
Fetch weather data from OpenWeather API in JSON format.
Send an HTTP request to the API, receiving the data as a response.

Transform:
Convert temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius.
Convert timestamps into readable date/time formats.
Structure the raw data into a clean tabular format using a Pandas DataFrame.

Load:
Connect to a PostgreSQL database.
Insert the transformed data into a database table for persistent storage.

Key Considerations
Data Size: The program fetches a large amount of data (up to 240 hours of forecast data). This could potentially impact performance, so consider reducing the cnt parameter if needed.
Error Handling: The code currently doesn't handle errors like connection issues with the API or database. You may want to add try-except blocks to handle such issues gracefully.
Data Quality: Data from APIs can sometimes be incomplete or incorrect. Consider adding checks for missing values or outliers.



Possible Enhancements
Error Logging: Add logging functionality to track errors during the ETL process.
Scheduled Execution: Use a tool like cron (Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to automate the running of this script at regular intervals (e.g., daily or weekly).
Data Validation: Implement checks to ensure the data is valid before loading it into the database (e.g., non-null checks, valid temperature ranges).
