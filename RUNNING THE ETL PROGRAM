Running the ETL Program

Set Up:
Install required libraries: requests, pandas, matplotlib, sqlalchemy, psycopg2.
Get your OpenWeather API key and replace the placeholder in the code.
Set up a PostgreSQL database and update the connection details in the script.

Execution:
Run the script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE).
The program will fetch weather data, process it, generate a temperature chart, and store the processed data in your database.

Outcome:
You will see a chart displaying temperature trends over time.
The processed data will be available in the specified PostgreSQL database for further querying and analysis.
